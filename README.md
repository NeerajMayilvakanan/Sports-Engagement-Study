# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Sports and Student Performance Analysis

This project explores the relationship between **sports engagement**, **health status**, and **academic performance** among students, categorized by age groups (below and above 18). Through data visualization, clustering, and classification models, it identifies patterns and insights that highlight the importance of physical activity.

---

## üìä Project Overview

- **Goal**: Analyze how sports participation influences academic results and health conditions in students.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Correlation analysis
  - K-means clustering
  - Classification (KNN, SVM, Random Forest)

---

## üß† Key Insights

- Students active in sports tend to have fewer hospital visits and higher academic performance.
- Excessive mobile usage and low sports involvement correlate with poor health and lower CGPA.
- Random Forest outperformed other classification models with the highest accuracy.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Preprocessing & Visualization
- Machine Learning models for clustering & classification
